There are mainly 3 steps involoved here : 
- Calculate Dark Channel Prior value
- Calculate Transmission map
- Calculate Guided Filter Transmission map
- Restore the image


1) Calculate Dark Channel Prior
- Initially we take radius of 7 pixels.Now we calculate the minimum  pixel value across the third axis.This operation  calculates the minimum value for each pixel across all color channels, resulting in a grayscale image.
